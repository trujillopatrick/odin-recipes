        <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican stew made with meat (usually pork, but sometimes chicken), hominy,<br> chile peppers, and various seasonings. It’s traditionally topped with lettuce, cabbage, limes, onions,<br> avocados, and/or radishes.</p>

        <p> Pozole verde is made with a green sauce, while pozole rojo, such as this one, is made with a red sauce.</p>
